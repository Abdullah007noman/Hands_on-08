## This repository contains two different implementations:
* Quick sort with ith order static
* Implementation of stack,queue and singly limk list


## 1. Quick sort with ith order static
A Python implementation of the quicksort algorithm and the i-th order statistic using the Quickselect method. The code demonstrates how to leverage quicksort to determine the i-th smallest element in an array efficiently.
## Features
  * Quicksort Algorithm: A recursive sorting algorithm that uses divide-and-conquer.
  * Quickselect Algorithm: A variation of quicksort to find the i-th smallest element without fully sorting the array.

## How It Works
  * Quicksort: The array is recursively partitioned around a pivot, sorting the array in ascending order.
  * i-th Order Statistic (Quickselect):
       * Instead of sorting the entire array, Quickselect focuses on finding the desired element by partially partitioning the array.
       * This reduces unnecessary computation and improves efficiency.

#  2. Implementation of stack,queue and singly link list

This program contains a Python implementation of three fundamental data structures: Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List. The implementation adheres to the following constraints:

*   **Data Structures:** Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List
*   **Implementation Language:** Python
*   **Data Storage:** Integers only
*   **Storage Type:** Fixed-size arrays (emulating C-style arrays)
*   **API/Interface:** The code adheres to the API/interface conventions described in *Introduction to Algorithms* (3rd ed.) by Cormen et al.

## Code Structure

The core implementation is within the `DataStructures` class, found in `data_structures.py`.
