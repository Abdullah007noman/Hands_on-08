This repository contains a Python implementation of the quicksort algorithm and the i-th order statistic using the Quickselect method. The code demonstrates how to leverage quicksort to determine the i-th smallest element in an array efficiently.

## Features
  * Quicksort Algorithm: A recursive sorting algorithm that uses divide-and-conquer.
  * Quickselect Algorithm: A variation of quicksort to find the i-th smallest element without fully sorting the array.

## How It Works
  * Quicksort: The array is recursively partitioned around a pivot, sorting the array in ascending order.
  * i-th Order Statistic (Quickselect):
       * Instead of sorting the entire array, Quickselect focuses on finding the desired element by partially partitioning the array.
       * This reduces unnecessary computation and improves efficiency.
